= SPEC-001: ToDo App with Flutter, Node.js/Express, and PouchDB
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The development of a ToDo application serves as a portfolio project to demonstrate proficiency in Flutter for front-end development, Node.js/Express for backend API services, and PouchDB as a serverless, document-oriented database similar to MongoDB. This project aims to showcase the ability to build a cross-platform mobile application with a focus on modern, scalable technologies and the adaptability to learn new database management systems.

== Requirements

The application will follow the MoSCoW prioritization to ensure a focused and efficient development process.

.Must Have

* Cross-platform application support using Flutter.
* User authentication to allow for personal ToDo lists.
* CRUD operations for ToDo items.
* Serverless database integration with PouchDB for storing ToDo items.
* RESTful API server using NodeJS/Express for handling business logic and database operations.

.Should Have
* Real-time updates of ToDo items across devices.
* Task prioritization within the app.

.Could Have
* Task sharing capabilities with other users.
* Push notifications for reminders.

.Won't Have (for now)
* Integration with external calendars or productivity tools.
* Offline access and syncing capabilities.



== Method

=== Architecture Overview

The application architecture includes a Flutter-based front-end, a Node.js/Express backend API, and PouchDB for database management. This combination supports a lightweight, scalable, and easily deployable application suitable for portfolio demonstration.

=== Database Integration with PouchDB

PouchDB is chosen for its simplicity, serverless nature, and MongoDB-like syntax, facilitating ease of use and learning. The database will store user and task data, allowing for easy setup and execution.

.Database Schema

* Users Collection: `UserID`, `Username`, `Email`, `PasswordHash`, `ProfileImage`.
* Tasks Collection: `TaskID`, `UserID`, `Title`, `Description`, `Priority`, `Status`, `DueDate`.

=== API Design

RESTful APIs will be implemented for user authentication, task management, and password recovery, providing a simple yet effective interface for the Flutter frontend. All endpoints will include versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`).



.API Endpoints

* User Authentication: `/api/v1/auth` for login/signup, session checks, and password recovery.
* Tasks Management: `/api/v1/tasks` for CRUD operations on tasks.

=== Flutter Frontend Design

The Flutter app will feature multiple screens for user interaction, including authentication, task viewing, editing, and creation, enriched with animations and transitioning effects for a more dynamic user experience

.Technologies Used

* Flutter for cross-platform mobile development.
* Dart for programming the Flutter app.
* Provider package for state management.
* HTTP package for RESTful API communication.

== Implementation

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Dedicated learning phase for PouchDB and Provider, including practical exercises.
2. **Week 3**: Setup project structure, initialize Git repository, and create basic Flutter app layout with introductory animations.
3. **Week 4**: Develop the Node.js/Express API, integrate PouchDB, and implement user authentication along with the API versioning.
4. **Week 5**: Implement CRUD operations for tasks in the API and integrate these with the Flutter frontend, ensuring smooth animations for task interactions.
5. **Weeks 6-8**: Finalize the UI/UX in Flutter, ensure real-time updates are functioning with animations, and conduct thorough testing and refinements.

== Milestones

1. **Learning and Training Completion**: Completion of the dedicated learning phase for PouchDB and Provider.
2. **Project Setup and Initial Commit**: Completion of project scaffolding for both frontend and backend, with initial animations setup.
3. **Backend API and Database Integration**: Functional API with authentication, password recovery, and basic task management.
4. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Complete integration of Flutter frontend with backend APIs, enriched with animations.
5. **Feature Completion and Testing**: All planned features implemented and tested, with a focus on dynamic animations and user experience.

== Gathering Results

Upon completion, the application will be evaluated based on the ease of setup, functionality of the CRUD operations, real-time updates with animations, and overall user experience. Feedback will be solicited from peers and potential employers to assess the application's impact on the developer's portfolio.
